# MarketPlaceApp_Laura

This is a market place project that allows users to posut wanted objects or objects they want to sale. They can filter for the object tags, create a min-max price filter, find by name of the object and see the images of the objects they're going to purchase. 

The project is divided into 4 main files:
The Index file is where the app is initialized and the project is set to start
The Items file is where the item's template is set and prepared to be used in mongoDB
The Inint-db is where the app conects to the data base and creates the objects
The route file is where the API and the endpoints are created to set the interactions between the API and the database. 

I also added an environement I have created. This file should never be added in these kind of files but I have added it for completions sake.
